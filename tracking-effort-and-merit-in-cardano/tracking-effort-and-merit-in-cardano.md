### An NFT Award prototype for the Catalyst Idea Fest - New Mindflow  - [5:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf74Ia7UMlU&t=328s)

### Fungible and Non-Fungible Awards - [6:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf74Ia7UMlU&t=384s)

### Processes of discovery in how to recognize contribution using NFTs- Stephen Whitenstall - [6:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf74Ia7UMlU&t=419s)

### An experiment in recognition and encouraging participation - New Mindflow  - [7:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf74Ia7UMlU&t=441s)

### Some tracking related to voting ? - Stephen Whitenstall, New Mindflow - [9:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf74Ia7UMlU&t=543s)

At the end of Idea Fest there will be polls to gather votes from attendees to track the popularity of presentations.

### Do the polls gauge the public's reaction or to acknowledge participation ? - Tyler Wales, New Mindflow - [10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf74Ia7UMlU&t=611s)

We have tiers of recognition. A General Participation Award and By Category of Proposal Presentation. To gauge the public's reaction to the presentations. - New Mindflow

### Immediate recognition as one aspect of tracking  - Stephen Whitenstall - [11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf74Ia7UMlU&t=679s)

### Thoughts on recognition  - Jonathan Adjei - [11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf74Ia7UMlU&t=695s)

### How do we gather in contributions from across the Cardano ecosystem ?  - Jonathan Adjei - [12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf74Ia7UMlU&t=746s)

Now there are NFTs for Idea Fest, SPOCRA \(Cardano Stake Pool Operators\) have issued Awards and a Kudos bot in The Catalyst Alliance \(TCA\) Discord Server. Cardano Project Catalyst Discord Roles - people get assigned roles if they are particularly active. The Community Advisor and Veteran Community Advisors need recognizing. There could be NFTs to recognise all these roles.

### Do NFT Awards accrue value in themselves & can we remove that value ?  - Jonathan Adjei - 14:26

### Vesting periods - Stephen Whitenstall  - 14:57

### Why not use an aggregation layer like SourceCred ? - Dan Verowski   - 15:23

To avoid the difficulty of minting a specific NFT every time you want to reward a contribution why not use an aggregation layer like SourceCred? Then just take the data and put it in a very small format like JSON, validate it, put it as metadata on a Catalst ID or passport NFT. That is individual to each person in the Catalyst community who has a Cardano wallet address or Ideascale account. Then just aggregate the contribution data as an NFT. Later on you can vest the NFT for a certain amount of time and access a faucet where you can take \(binding or non-binding \) voting tokens. And get a proportional amount of tokens to your reputation. Non-binding voting could be returned, whilst binding voting tokens could be lost. To incentivize making the right decision on the vote.

### An experiment for Catalyst wide recognition systems - New Mindflow  - 17:59	

Specifically targeting non-funded proposals as the group most in need of recognition and reward. Funded proposals get funded, Community Advisors and Veteran Community Advisors get rewards. But it is possible to put a lot of hours into a proposal and you end up with nothing to show for it. Which is potentially demoralising and a disincentive to participate in the Catalyst process in the future.

### Ideally the Community Advisor input and feedback would have its own value - Dan Verowski  - 19:10

### Broadening out the Awards NFTs to reward unfunded people- Stephen Whitenstall  - 19:52

### Funded proposals have a burnout problem too - Tyler Wales - 20:21

If the funding is not enough to compensate everyone in a collaborative project the same problem of being unrewarded and disincentivized arises.

### Community Advisors overworked - Tyler Wales - 21:21

Community Advisors are overworked. In the most recent proposals there were only 4 or 5 CAs rank each one.
