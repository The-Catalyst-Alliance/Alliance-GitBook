### Creating NFT badges as a means of tracking merit

Newmindflow is interested in contributing to NFT rewards

In respect of game development experience, Tevo has created a MMORPG game

Awarding people for participation with and NFT badge

Badges could be showcased on platforms such as :

We could begin by manually awarding NFT badges, then later figure out automation.

Looking at our track record, we can emulate who participates which is useful for IOG

If we lay down measurements then we can align on a track record, we can perhaps track the experts ballots created by community.

### SourceCred

Source cred is also something we are looking into to experiment with.

Either for Github or Discord.

But we can start seeing how it will work on Discord.

### Fund 4 Results

Congrats to Fund 4 winners

We should think out of the box every time - Vladimir

#### Gimbalabs Solidarity

How we could give Gimbalabs the Solidarity the need?

There was a discussion of changing the fund rewarding system. The possibility that proposers could discuss between themselves allocation if proposals are skipped. That budget cuts could be allowed to achieve funding.

Connect with James if his interested alternative funding methods

Connect with Rik \(Digital Fortress\) and see if we can run similar campaign like we did for WADA. Community can have powerful message to get behind an idea in public matter

### Statistical Analysis of Fund 4 

How many voters are from community. How many whales decides what happens?

Maybe there is correlation in the worst performed funds? see how much ADA voted against.

### Ideafest

With the help of the Catalyst community we will experiment with a stage for all the proposers to present themselves.

What are effective marketing efforts?

How much do Community Advisor ratings and voting ratings correlate ? \(Victor on it\).

### What is the core purpose of the Alliance ?

We might be missing pragmatism

IOG doesn't really explain what community should work towards.

Building governance structure using ideascale.
